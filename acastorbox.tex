\begin{abstract}
Future experiments in high energy and nuclear physics may require
large, inexpensive calorimeters that can continue to
operate after receiving doses of 50~Mrad
or more. We present the results of a study of a scintillator tile
based on EJ-309 liquid scintillator using cosmic rays, test beam, and
${\rm ^{60}Co}$ irradiations that shows little degradation of light output
under irradiation.

\section{Introduction}
During the running of the LHC from its commissioning in 2009
through 2012, the CMS
detector was exposed to an integrated luminosity of 25 ${\rm fb^{-1}}$.  Parts of the
CMS endcap calorimeter are estimated to have received doses of 0.1 to 0.2 Mrad~\cite{ecfa2015}.
Studies of the radiation hardness of scintillator tiles
prior to installation in the detector,
using an electron linac and ${\rm ^{60}Co}$ sources,
indicated an exponential reduction in 
light output with accumulated dose, with a exponential constant of 
around 7 Mrad~\cite{vasken,ByonWagner1993263}.  
However, although the dose received by the CMS tiles was
small compared to this number,
significant light loss was observed ~\cite{phaseiitdr}.

\section{Conclusions}

We presented results for a liquid scintillating tile using WLS fiber readout. For our nominal design, $1.7\pm 0.2$\,pe's
were produced for minimum ionizing particles.
